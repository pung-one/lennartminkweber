        In the summer of 1999 on the top of a hill near the small German town of
        Nebra, two illegally-operating treasure hunters sunk their shovels into
        the earth and felt metal on metal.
        <br />
        <br />
        As they dropped to their knees and scooped the dirt from whatever it was
        they had found, their minds must have raced with imaginings of untold
        treasures. Even still, what lay waiting would surpass the stuff of
        fantasy and while both men would receive prison sentences for their
        plundering, they had in fact uncovered one of archaeology's
        greatest-ever finds: a bronze disc, 30cm in diameter and dotted in gold
        with what is immediately recognisable as a sun, a moon and 32 stars.
        <br />
        <br />
        Dated at somewhere between 1800-1600 BCE, the Nebra Sky Disk
        (Himmelsscheibe von Nebra) is the oldest celestial map ever discovered.
        <br />
        <br />
        The two men sold the disc to a dealer in Cologne and after changing
        hands on the black market for several years, it was eventually recovered
        in a sting operation in Basel in 2002, when it moved into the possession
        of the Landesmuseum für Vorgeschichte in Halle.
        <br />
        <br />
        Subsequent testing has suggested the disc might have originally been
        stained black: the vacuum of space contrasting against the disc's golden
        cosmological features to create what would have been a sacred object of
        the highest importance.
        <br />
        <br />
        Hard science and astrology underpinned the placement of the gold leaf
        details; archaeologists believe the cluster of stars on the forehead of
        the disc (between the moon and the sun) is a representation of the
        Pleiades, while the edges of the curved strip - the disc's smiling mouth
        - appear to have marked the points of sunrise at the beginning and end
        of the agricultural year.
        <br />
        <br />
        At Goseck in Germany, at least 2,000 years before Stonehenge was erected
        in England and thousands of years earlier than the creation of the Sky
        Disk, stood a wooden henge, with gates or openings in the exact same (to
        the degree) solstice-indicative positions as on the Nebra disc.
        <br />
        <br />
        While modern techniques have allowed us to date such objects and sites
        accurately, or identify specific explanations, the shear age of such
        examples preserves a level of the unknown. That inability to read their
        meaning definitively, to remove all mystery, is what continues to fuel
        their power all these millennia later. In a way, it's our insertion of
        narrative into, or placement of it onto, these objects and sites that
        ensures they remain more than archived historical facts. Their ambiguity
        reaches out from the shadowy past and calls to us.
        <br />
        <br />
        In late 2021, at the Landesmuseen in Halle - where the Nebra Sky Disk
        still resides - a man explored the disc's surface via a virtual reality
        experience. He rode in what many believe to be some sort of sky ship
        (the disc's mouth), flying through the disc's starry night sky, and
        walking amongst its henge-like solstice markers.
        <br />
        <br />
        At one point, though, he accidentally transported himself to another
        connected site.
        <br />
        <br />
        “Schon wieder bei Stonehenge”, he said, apparently unaware that others
        watched on as he stumbled around a circular room wearing large,
        ill-fitting goggles.
        <br />
        <br />
        His disappointment at such a miraculous teleportation seemed to
        metaphorically reflect the anticlimax of rummaging around the mystical
        world; a certain level of distance is required to, perhaps at least
        spiritually, fully appreciate the disc. To find oneself inhabiting it is
        to strip it of its majesty, of its robes. It is to see it only as its
        material self: a small disc of bronze, scattered with
        geometrically-designed gold leaf shapes. And then back to Stonehenge: a
        circular formation of big rocks.
        <br />
        <br />
        This phenomena is not limited to the Sky Disc or England's neolithic
        national treasure. It's the thrill of the chase, it's the
        every-detail-accounted-for work of art, the level-headed explanation of
        natural phenomena: magic exists, if even only in our own wandering
        imaginations. That is, of course, until it's explained away.
        <br />
        <br />
        There is the argument that it is human kind's penchant for
        story-telling, the spiritual aspect of humanity, that separates us from
        previous versions of ourselves. Or that defines us. After all, what are
        we without our stories? Earlier species of the homo genus possessed
        knowledge; they invented and developed tool-making. Certainly homo
        erects displayed the capacity of abstract mark-making. Yet it remains
        highly doubtful that they questioned their origins or futures and they
        almost certainly didn't tell each other what indigenous Australian's
        call dreaming stories, spiritual explanations for the world around them.
        <br />
        <br />
        Lennart Weber's work flexes in the unexplained. It may appear to either
        have or have had function - but the nature of that function remains
        beyond our grasp. We have only our stories, with Weber's work acting as
        intermediary. Our own interpretation or placement of narrative breathes
        life into it. As we speak to it, it to us.
        <br />
        <br />
        Did Weber make the work or have we? In that sense it seems almost a
        collaborative effort: a union. But then an an orchestrated union. Weber
        seduces us into the work with highly-crafted handling of material: the
        contrast of polished aluminium against deadened cloth - its riveted
        cosmos shining back at us. The coolness of space and of metal again
        juxtaposed by the warmth of amber-toned resin. A close-up of the
        adjoining galactic snapshot? Or a view from the plane's window down to a
        sleeping population? Both? The artist offers enough here that one wants
        to connect the dots and indeed begins to do so. But as the lines between
        points are drawn, it becomes apparent that no pre-defined Disney
        character will materialise into existence. Although Weber has
        deliberately and delicately placed each point for us to connect, what
        that connection process produces is entirely up to us.

        <i>How Objects Become Passwords</i>
        <br />
        <br />
        Lonely Planet Boy by Lennart Mink Weber (2022) is composed of four
        rectangular fields. On the upper left and lower right, the panels are
        made of aluminium sheets covered with black pinstripe fabric. On the
        left panel, blind rivets are attached to the fabric in irregular
        circles. Across the right panel, an aluminium section slightly overhangs
        the picture frame to the outside. On the two other panels, on the lower
        left and upper right, the aluminium sheets have been left bare, which,
        unlike the dull fabric, reflects light. Blind rivets are again attached
        to the lower left panel, and five cylinders cast in different diameters
        of green and yellow plastic are attached to the upper right panel.
        <br />
        <br />
        While the upper black fabric panel with the round rivets evokes
        associations with a starry sky, the two aluminium panels are more
        reminiscent of the cool perfection of industrial production. But how
        does a romantic allusion reconcile with the objectivity of an industrial
        product? Aren't they contradictory? The individual fields are partially
        framed by aluminium strips. One bar divides the image vertically, the
        other crosses the lower black field diagonally. The ledges create the
        impression of imbalance, movement, and incompleteness, which is enhanced
        by the constantly changing reflection of light.
        <br />
        <br />
        Yet movement and change are at odds with the overall panel, which is
        static and geometrically arranged. Finality meets incompleteness here -
        how is that to be understood? Movement, which always also means
        transformation, is shaped by objects made of aluminium strips,
        resembling perhaps drums or pots, and covered with pinstripe fabric,
        such as Riv. They live from the tension between the final form and the
        rotation inherent in each spiral movement. Another example would be
        Schiffer (2021), a four-meter tall pole reminiscent of a boat mast and
        made of riveted aluminium sections, to which door handles cast in resin
        are attached at an intangible height. What is their possible function?
        "To catch light", says the artist.
        <br />
        <br />
        And why does the artist refer to the password as a suitable figure of
        thought in relation to his objects? Is it because, similar to the
        password, its semantic meaning as a word, number or sign is cancelled by
        its function? But for every question asked, another contradiction is
        placed in front of you that cannot be resolved or doesn't want to be
        resolved. Contradictions that point to the absurdity of the work, which
        is also reflected in the title of the exhibition I Can't Tell A Hawk
        From A Handsaw, a line borrowed from William Shakespeare's Hamlet. The
        artist already eludes resolution here, as he turns the quotation into
        its opposite. Whoever wants to, can try to wrest an unambiguous
        statement from this pun.
        <br />
        <br />
        The desire to solve contradictions and thus to be able to explain the
        world definitively is the legacy of modernity that still shapes our
        Western thinking. But there have always been some doubters of this
        project even within modernism, among them Franz Kafka and Samuel
        Beckett, who, through their writing, consciously tried to lead this
        desire ad absurdum. Against this background, Lennart Mink Weber's
        objects are clever provocations marked by subliminal humour that
        challenge our inherited desire for unambiguous and definitive
        interpretations.
